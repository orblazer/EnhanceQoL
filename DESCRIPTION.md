## Philosophy

Enhance QoL is community-driven: players suggest ideas and features are implemented quickly. The goal is not to replace major addons but to fill the small gaps Blizzard leaves behind, while staying efficient and unobtrusive.

Play your way – let *Enhance QoL* take care of the little things so you can focus on the fun parts of Azeroth.
